    /// 1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero
    /// 
    /// Given an integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero.
    /// 
    /// In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.
    /// 
    /// Example 1:
    /// Input: num = 14
    /// Output: 6
    /// Explanation: 
    /// Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7. 
    /// Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
    /// Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3. 
    /// Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2. 
    /// Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1. 
    /// Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
